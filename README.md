# E-Commerce Recommendation System

This project is a content-based filtering recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. It suggests products to users based on their preferences by analyzing product descriptions and features.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommendations are made using similarities between products.
- **Real-Time Functionality**: Built with Flask to handle requests and provide recommendations dynamically.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Utilizes TF-IDF to analyze and compare product descriptions.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleans and preprocesses the data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize features.
   - Text data is vectorized using TF-IDF for similarity calculation.

2. **Recommendation Logic**: 
   - Calculates the cosine similarity between products.
   - Suggests the most similar products based on the user's input.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Flask handles user input through API endpoints.
   - Returns recommended products in real time.
